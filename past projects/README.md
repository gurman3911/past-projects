I am really new to this OpenAI and GPT hope you like it. 



##The main model is made with OpenAI's Davinci model and it is run on a web application library called Streamlit 
### To start the program you need to write [ streamlit run (application name i.e. in this case is webapp.py) ] code in your command prompt
I will provide screen shots of the project for easier understanding as writing command lines might be wast of time
