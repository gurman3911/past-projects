# Fluid-stock-prediction-model
### the model sucessfully gave accuracy of more than 98% and is highly accurate 
the model is made to predict upcoming stock's or niftys colsing price accouding to serveral factors such as price action and indicators.
the model takes 30 days of previous price action of various features and provides future price for the market
the project was made upon google colab and used RTX 2060 gpu for trianing and prediction
### LSTM neural network are used to make the model efficient 
### Concatenation architecture was used to provide inputs thus redicing complexity of the model

## The model with more tweeks and features can provide more accurate results
